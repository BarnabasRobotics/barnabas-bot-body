# Robot Head

We have three(3) heads to choose from and will happily accept pull requests. Each head needs a base for access a mounting screw for the servo motor unless the head is designed in a way to make this possible by some other means. The base plates are not interchangable at this time so be sure you use the correct one for printing.

The three(3) heads available are:

- Dome
- Cylinder
- Cube
